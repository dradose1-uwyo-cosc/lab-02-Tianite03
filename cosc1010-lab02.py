## Section ONE

# Complete the following print statement to print out "Hello, COSC1010"
print("Hello, COSC1010")

# Assign the string above to a variable named hello_message and print that variable
hello_message = "Hello, COSC1010"
print(hello_message)

cowboy = "cowboy joe"
print(cowboy.title)

# Complete the following f-string print message 
    UW = "University of Wyoming"
    date = "1886."
print(f"The {UW} was founded in {date}")

# Now let's do some math with variables 
   varX = 5
    varY = 10
    # Complete the following print statements using your variables
    #All math must be done within the braces in the f-strings
print(f"x + y = {varX + varY}")
print(f"x - y = {varX - varY}")
print(f"x * y = {varX * varY}")
print(f"x / y = {varX / varY}")

# String concatenation 
    # Finally we will take a look at string concatenation
    # String concatenation combines two strings together
    # It is done using the + operator
    # Create three variables:
        first_name = "Talon"
        last_name = "Bluemel"
        space = " "
    print ("first_name" + "space" + "last_name")
